Course description

This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their major, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Python programming language.

How is this repository organised?

1. Each individual part of all the units will have a separate folder. The folder will be named taking the parts name and converting it from "Introduction to 6.00" to "1-introduction-to-600".
2. Inside the parts folder, there will be

> 1. "notes-1.md" - all the notes taken while watching the lecture
> 2. "lecture-code-1.py" - all the code written
> 3. "handout-1.py" - the lectures handout (if any)
> 4. "problem-set-0.md" - the assigned problem set with its ID corresponding to the one provided
> 5. "problem-set-0.py" - the solution(-s) to said problem set
