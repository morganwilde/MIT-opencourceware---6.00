### How long it takes for a population to stop growing

After running `1000` tests, the mean amount of steps before the population stops growing is - `53` (with the standard deviation of `3.73614761486`).

Below is a sample illustrating a single simulation of growth:

Here is the distribution of the number of steps before growth stops:
