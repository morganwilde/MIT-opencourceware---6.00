Due: 11:59pm, Lecture 2 (two days to complete).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Introduction</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This problem set will introduce you to the programming environment IDLE and to programming in Python, as well as to our general problem set structure. In this problem set, you will install IDLE, write a simple Python program, and hand it in. Be sure to read this problem set thoroughly, especially the sections of Collaboration and the Hand-in Procedure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Collaboration</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You may work with other students. However, each student should write up and hand in his or her assignment separately. Be sure to indicate with whom you have worked. For further detail, please review the collaboration policy as stated in the course information handout.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Installing Python and IDLE</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Follow the steps in Getting Python for installing Python and IDLE onto the machine you plan to be using this term.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Familiarize yourself with Python and IDLE using the exercises given in the handout. Once you are ready, proceed to the programming part of this assignment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Note, when you first start using your system, make sure that the version number displayed is not 3.0 or higher. That version of Python is not backwards compatible with 2.5.4, which is the official Python version used in this course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A Very Simple Program: Entering and Printing Your Name</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The goal of this programming exercise is simply to get you more comfortable with using IDLE, and to begin using simple elements of Python. Standard elements of a program include the ability to print out results (using the print operation), the ability to read input from a user at the console (for example using the raw_input or input function), and the ability to store values in a variable, so that the program can access that value as needed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Problem 1</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Write a program that does the following in order: Asks the user to enter his/her date of birth. Asks the user to enter his/her last name. Prints out the user&rsquo;s last name and date of birth, in that order.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c8"><span class="c2">An example of an interaction with your program is shown below (the words printed in blue are from the computer, based on your commands, the words in black are a user&rsquo;s input &ndash; the colors are simply here to help you distinguish the two components):</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c7">Enter your date of birth: **01/26/32 Enter your last name: **Grimson Grimson 01/26/32</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Hints:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To see how to use the print command, you may find it convenient to look at the input and output section of the Python Wikibook. This will show you how to use print statements to print out values of strings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To see how to read input from a user&rsquo;s console into the Python environment, you may find it convenient to look at the same section (see for example the raw_input or input function).</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2">Remember that if you want to hold onto a value, you need to store it in a variable (i.e., give it a name to which you can refer when you want that value). You may find it convenient to look at the variables and strings section of the Python Wikibook.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hand-In Procedure</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">1. Save</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Save your code in ps0.py. Do not ignore this step or save your file(s) with different names.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">2. Time and Collaboration Info</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At the start of each file, in a comment, write down the number of hours (roughly) you spent on the problems in that part, and the names of the people you collaborated with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c11">For example: # Problem Set 0 # Name: Jane Lee # Collaborators: John Doe # Time Spent: 3:30</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">... your code goes here ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">3.
