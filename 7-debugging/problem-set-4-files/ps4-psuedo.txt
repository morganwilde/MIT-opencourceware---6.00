Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:

emailText - my friends message
shift = 0 - my first guess
while shift is less than 28
    decoder of shift
    decode text using decoder
    for each word in decoded text
        check if it is a valid english word
        if no
            leave both loops
    if we got here that means all words have a meaning
    correct shift is shift
    stop loop

Write out your algorithm for Problem 4 here:

function multi_level takes phrase, shifts = [(0,0)]
    if text contains only english words
        return shift
    else
        for each possible shift
            if word is english
                position of next words first letter
            if position is set
                call self with remaining unrecognized text (but shifted)
